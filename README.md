# Portfolio 1
Creating a portfolio page.

## Description

This project's purpose was to create a web application from scratch!  


## Code Highlights

I builded a portfolio page from scrath. I created the framework first then I tried to use semantic HTML elements so my page can be accessible. 
In CSS I used flex element and grid layout. I used the pseudo-elements as well. I completed my page by adding a little color on it.
